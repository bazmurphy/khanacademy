What to learn next
==================

Congratulations on learning how to manipulate your webpages with JavaScript!

Using new HTML features
-----------------------

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all evolving technologies. They include many features that we didn't cover in this course, and they continue to change to meet the needs of web developers.

Here are some examples of new features to explore:

-   [Video and audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)
-   [Web storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)
-   [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)

Browse more [web technologies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) or search the web for the feature you're interested in---it might actually exist!

Bringing in data to your page
-----------------------------

Many webpages let the users interact with dynamic data, like from a database or service. If you have your webpage hosted on your own server, you can bring it in using [AJAX(Opens in a new window)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX). If you want to bring the data from an external server and that server makes that data available to others, you can bring it in using [their public API](https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis).

Note that our webpages environment only allows you to bring in data from [certain servers](https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/articles/205175520-What-resources-images-scripts-etc-can-I-bring-into-webpages-that-I-make-on-Khan-Academy-), and those servers must be called via SSL (`https://`). Check your developer console to see if you're trying to bring in data from a disallowed server, and use a development environment other than Khan Academy if needed.

Keeping up to date
------------------

Browsers release improvements often and the web development community is an active one. One of our favorite ways to keep up-to-date with what's new is to subscribe to [Frontend Focus](http://html5weekly.com/) and [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/), newsletters with links to articles and demos. Of course, whenever you learn something new, you should try it out to really understand how it works.

Practice, practice, practice!
